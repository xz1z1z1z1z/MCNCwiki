### Stage instructions

1. In the first stage (Group Stage), the players will be divided into 8 groups of 4 players.
   - This may change depending on how many players are accepted into the competition at the end.
2. All the players from each group will face each other.
3. Rankings of each group are determined by sorting the results of each player's performance in the following priority:
   - Most matches won.
   - Have higher `{(the number of beatmaps won) - (the number of beatmaps defeated)}`.
   - Most beatmaps won.
   - **Winner of the match played previously between the tied players.**
   - In the event of a triple tie:
     - Have higher `∑{(total score difference) / (maximum score)}`.
     - Winner of the rematch.
4. The top 2 players of each group will move on to the knock-out stages.
   - This may change with the actual Group Stage setup.
5. Following stages are double elimination stages. This means that the winner moves on to the next stage and the losing player gets moved to the losers' bracket.
6. The **Winning conditions** for each stage will be:
   - In Group Stage, you need to win 5 beatmaps to win a match. (best of 9)
   - In the Round of 16 and the Quarterfinals, you need to win 6 beatmaps to win a match. (best of 11)
   - In Semifinals, **Finals and Grand Finals**, you need to win 7 beatmaps to win a match. (best of 13)

### Match instructions

1. A referee will create a multiplayer room 15 minutes in advance. Players must gather during this period. Room settings are osu!mania, Head-To-Head, Win Condition: "ScoreV2". Room name must be "MCNC: (Red) vs (Blue)".
2. Warmups during the Group Stages may not have a length higher than 3 minutes. Bracket Stages may be no longer than 5 minutes (unless agreed by both side). Warmups are optional when allowed.
3. Players are allowed to ban 1 map each for each match alternating between the players with no restrictions except that each player must ban from mappool.
Before matches will start, the captain of each player will roll and the one with the highest roll will choose their warmup first (if they would like their warmup), pick maps from the mappool first and ban one map from the mappool second. Picks will alternate as well.
4. Players will be given at most 2 minutes for picking/banning each map. Players taking to long to make a ban/pick will result in losing their ban/pick. Continued stalling will result in the other player's banning/picking instead.
5. Players will be given at most 3 minutes for fielding the desired roster for the map. The map will start 3 minutes after the map has been chosen, with no exceptions barring technical issues.
6. For free mod picks, mod is optional for either of the player, with selectable mods being EZ, HD, HR, FI, and FL. Note there is no score multiplication for the Easy mod (EZ).
7. Should both players be at match point, or in other words should both players be one point away from winning, the tiebreaker is played as the last map instead. The tiebreaker map shares the same rule as the free mod maps.
8. There are no restrictions on what a player can or cannot pick, with the exception that the map being picked must be from the mappool for that match, has not been picked during the match, and cannot have been banned prior to the pick phase.
9. In the event of a tie during a map, the map is to be replayed. Should the map need to be replayed more than twice, then the player who selected that map may select another map with the replayed map being banned for the rest of the match. Should the pool run out of eligible maps this way, any nonbanned map may be picked again, overruling the previous rule of "maps picked cannot have been picked during the match yet".
10. Both players are allowed to restart a map at most once due to disconnects and other technical issues if the map has not proceeded for 30 seconds or longer. Same mods and roster must be used should a restart commence. Please try to fix any and all issues as much as possible prior to the match.
11. The referees may nullify rules at their discretion if necessary, and have the final say in what occurs during the match.
